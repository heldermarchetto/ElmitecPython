# ElmitecPython

These procedures are meant for users of Elmitec Elektronenmikroskopie GmbH users.

You will find the following objects available:

**readUview**:

   This object can be installed as a package (see instructions below) and confortably used as an object to read .dat files produced with Uview.
   You will also need (not just for executing these procedures) numpy and matplotlib. Install these using the recommended method for anaconda (which is not using PIP).

**elmitecConnect**:

   This object allows to connect to a local or remote machine control imaging parameters (LEEM2000 devices) and image acquisition (UView)

For any questions please contact Helder Marchetto @ Elmitec.

If you wish to contribute, you are very welcome.
